                Huntsman has been making the world's finest handcrafted clothes since 1849. 
                The heart of Huntsman always has been, and always will be bespoke.

                But what sets bespoke tailoring apart from its made-to-measure or ready-to-wear counterparts?

              <p>
                Though both play their part in contemporary menswear, it is the art and craft of bespoke 
                tailoring, unchanged for centuries, that has been perfected into an art form. To guarantee 
                a feel and fit which is unparalleled, and a service which is unsurpassed.

                  Commissioning a bespoke garment is not unlike commissioning a portrait. It's an art 
                  form that begins with up to 28 measurements to create a 2D rendering of your body, 
                  as a paper pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Up to 80 hours of handwork by the most skilled team of cutters and tailors on Savile 
                  Row are woven into the soul of every one of our tailored garments. From measuring and 
                  drafting your paper pattern, to hand stitching and finishing details, no two bodies are 
                  the same, and so no two bespoke suits, shirts, or separates are the same.

                  No bespoke suit leaves our store until you are completely satisfied, which is why we 
                  will see you at least four times for your fittings.

                <p>
                  A bespoke design allows you that extra level of personalisation. Whether it is the 
                  luxury of silk printed lining, half an inch on a cuff, or a truly bespoke suit you will 
                  want to live in; the quality of our bespoke tailoring speaks for itself when you are 
                  still enjoying your garments in 20 years' time.

                Ready-to-wear or made to measure garments are made to a standard block that doesn't 
                accommodate for the uniqueness and nuances of the individual form.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                With a bespoke suit, handcrafted just for you, you will notice the difference as soon 
                as you put it on. Huntsman is dedicated to bespoke tailoring.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The made-to-measure services offered by other tailors use a standard-sized base pattern, 
                which is altered to your frame. Some modifications may occur, but you will never truly 
                enjoy that exclusive feeling of wearing a tailored suit.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                With bespoke tailoring starting from Â£6000, which is comparable to made-to-measure, 
                you can invest in a bespoke suit that is every bit as unique as you are without 
                compromising on quality.
